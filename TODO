	- can download and process both, then assign uuid to the climb with the best matching holds
figure out how to track limbs
figure out how to id holds given limb data
figure out how to reorient id'd holds to face-on
figure out how to matched id holds with holds from that climb
figure out best way to make that into sequence data
train model to predict beta given climb info
train model to predict grade given beta and climb info

		Videos --> Sports2D --> poses
		poses --> beta
		NN(board) --> beta
		NN(beta) --> grade
